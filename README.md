The Foundations of Deep Learning update takes its title from the cover of
`public/assets/FoundationsDeepLearning.pdf`. Replacing that PDF and running
`npm run build` (or restarting `npm run dev`) updates the title on the home page,
the Blog & Updates page, and the related blog post. The GitHub Pages workflow
also runs this build when the PDF is pushed.

# Make a new blog post:

1. `git pull`
2. Resolve any merge conflicts
3. Write the blog post in `content/blogs/[blog-name]/index.md`
4. Run `uv run gen.py`
5. Move the generated blog.svg to `content/blogs/[blog-name]/blog.svg`
6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m "Added new blog post [blog-name]"`
8. `git push`
